# intro
configure ray using either automatic or manual cluster set up
it seems manual works better

# add source (head machine) public key to all destination (worker) pcs via
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh USER@HOST "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

use `ray up ray_setup_minimal.yaml` to start ray cluster

use `ray status` to see status

check the "monitor autoscaling" command 

make sure redis is shutdown 
/etc/init.d/redis-server stop
