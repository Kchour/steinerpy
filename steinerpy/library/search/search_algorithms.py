    Generic search algorithm with open, closed, and linked lists. The user can pass in custom g,h functions 

    Parameters:
        graph (SquareGrid, MyGraph): An object from grid_utils/graph module.
            "SquareGrid" vertices are defined by 2D tuples (x_i, y_i) 
            "MyGraph"    vertices are defined N-dim tuples (z_1, ... , z_n). A generalized graph!
        start (tuple): Start vertex, `tuple` must belong to class <graph>.
        goal (tuple): End vertices, keyed by id. May be None
            For use with `Framework` class, must be an iterable (i.e. list, tuple, set) or `dict`
        frontierType (PriorityQueue()): The Open List or frontier class type, implemented as a class from search/search_utils/  
            (PriorityQueue, PriorityQueueHeap). A priority queue returns the item with min priority value.
        pCostsFunc: A function returning the pCosts of node u. Returns a scalar value. Arguments are (self, glist, next_node)
        id (tuple): An ID number for the current search object. Optional if not using `Framework`.

    Attributes:
        id: set by the parameter `id`
        graph: set by parameter `graph`
        start: set by parameter `start`
        goal: set by parameter `goal`
        current (tuple): The most recently expanded node, i.e. just added to the closed list
        frontier (frontierType): set by parameter `frontierType`
        g (dict): The cost_so_far dict in the form {v: value}, where "v" is a vertex/node and "value" is the gCost(v).
        parent (dict): A linked list (implemented with a dict), in the form {v: parent(v)}, where parent(v), is the parent node of "v". 
            Note that "v" is member of `graph`.
        fCosts (fCostsFunc): Defined by input parameter fCostsFunc, should return a scalar
        nominated (bool): True if our current search object has nominated a node, ensures we do not
            nominate more than once at a time
        closedList (dict): Consist of all previously expanded nodes, a dict {closed(v_i): fCosts}. Not necessary
        currentF (float): The Fcost of `current`
        minR (float): minimum radius of our set, by observing the boundary nodes. Not necessary atm
