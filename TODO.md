# TODO List
- Finish documenting modules and provide more examples of how to use library
- Consider using PRM* radius for proximity-based algorithm
- Need to get rid of warnings from animation libraries depending on matplotlib
- Add support for directed edges
- Better termination handling when nomination queue is empty (we just throw an error atm)
- Dont call reconstruct path since we are keeping track of root nodes, unless we are trying to visualize! Currently, visualization isn't even supported for generic graphs
- Add support generic graphs
- Remove unnecessary functions from `Common`
- Maintain lexicographic ordering for tables to save space
- Maintain global bounds (kruskal) via a priority queue heap
- Don't add all the randomized tests spreadsheets to git
