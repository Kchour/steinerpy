# TODO List
## Roadmap
- Finish documenting modules and provide more examples of how to use library
- Consider using PRM* radius for proximity-based algorithm
- Need to get rid of warnings from animation libraries depending on matplotlib
- Add support for directed edges
- Better termination handling when nomination queue is empty (we just throw an error atm)
- We can try optimizing the `path_check` function by keeping track of components that contain
a particular node in a separate dict, i.e. let each node be keyed by a set of components...
